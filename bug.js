```javascript
// pages/index.js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Hello</div>
  );
}
```

This code will cause an error in Next.js 15 if you have enabled the `experimental` features and are using the new `app` directory.  The error will likely be related to the file not being found at the expected location because the `pages` directory is no longer used by default in the `app`-based structure.  Next.js 15 will look for this file in the `app` directory, leading to a 404.
